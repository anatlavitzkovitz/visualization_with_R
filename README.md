# visualization_with_R
This repository contains R code for plots I use frequently. I found myself rewriting some of the code over and over and realized I should have it all centralized in one repository. 

__requirements:__

R - can be dowloaded from this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

If a specific package will be needed it will be added here

I recommend to use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)


Later I will add some test and test cases to run.
