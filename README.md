# visualization_with_R
This repository contains R code for plots I use frequently. I found myself rewriting some of the code over and over and realized I should have it all centralized in one repository. 

__requirements:__

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

If a specific package will be needed it will be added here

How to run the test?
